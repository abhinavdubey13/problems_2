/**
 * leetcode id : 1104
 *
 * In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are labelled in row order.
 *
 * In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is left to right,
 *
 * while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...), the labelling is right to left.
 *
 * Given the label of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from the root of the tree to the node with that label.
 *

/**
 * ============
 * approach : 1
 * ============
 *
 *
 * if the trr was not zig zag , it was an easy qstion , bcz pattern was clear
 * parent = node_data/2
 *
 *
 * here we need to find pattern , just like above secenario
 * parent = (max number at current level + min number at current level) - node_data
 *
 * ============
 * TC = O(log n)
 * SC = O(log n)
