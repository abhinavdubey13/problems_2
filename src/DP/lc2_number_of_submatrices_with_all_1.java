/**

 *
 *
 * Given a m * n matrix of ones and zeros, return how many square sub matrices have all ones.
 */


/**
 *
 * dp[i][j] means the size of biggest square with A[i][j] as bottom-right corner.
 * dp[i][j] also means the number of squares with A[i][j] as bottom-right corner.
 *
 * If A[i][j] == 0, no possible square.
 *
 * If A[i][j] == 1, then
 * we compare the size of square dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1].
 * min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1 is the maximum size of square that we can find.
 *
 *
 * "Your current element is only as strong as your weakest neighbour"
 *
 * ==============
 * TC =  R*C
 * SC = 1 (we can wuse the matric provided in input)
