/**
 * Leetcode id : 1219
 *
 * In a gold mine grid of size m x n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.
 *
 * Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:
 *
 * 1. Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
 * 2. From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
 * 3. You can't visit the same cell more than once.
 * 4. you cannot visit a cell with 0 gold.
 * 5. You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.
 *
 * ==========
 * example :
 * ==========
 *
 * Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
 * Output: 24
